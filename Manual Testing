Manual Testing Task1


1. Scenarios for the login screen:
   1. Valid username and password combination.
   2. Invalid username and valid password combination.
   3. Valid username and invalid password combination.
   4. Empty username field and Empty password field.
   5. Forgot password functionality.

2. Test Case for Scenario 1:
   Test Case Title: Successful Login with Valid Credentials
   Description:
   1. Open the Orange HRM Live application.
   2. Enter a valid username and password combination.
   3. Click on the login button.
   Expected Result: User should be logged in successfully and directed to the application dashboard.

3. Documenting the bug:
   Bug Title: "Error Occurred" message displayed despite providing correct credentials
   Description:
   When attempting to log in with the correct username and password combination, an "Error Occurred" message is displayed instead of successfully logging in to the system.
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Open the Orange HRM Live application.
   2. Enter the correct username and password combination.
   3. Click on the login button.
   Actual Result: "An error occurred" message is displayed.
   Expected Result: User should be logged in successfully and directed to the application dashboard.

4. Testing technique without focusing on the internal workings of the system is Black Box Testing.

5. Testing technique used to test the system focusing on the internal workings of the system is White Box Testing.

6. Boundary value analysis for numeric text field (0 to 100):
   - Inputs: -1, 0, 1, 99, 100, 101

7. The testing technique that allows testers to think outside the box and come up with use cases that might not be covered in predefined test cases is Exploratory Testing.


8. Reviewing documents (e.g., requirements, design) without
executing code falls under Static Testing, because we are not executing the software.

9. Type of testing involving executing the code to validate
Functionality is Dynamic Testing.

10. 1 Test level in Software Testing is Integration Testing, testing the interaction between modules or units to verify that they function together as expected.

11. The initial round of testing performed after a build is deployed is Smoke Testing.

12. Type of testing that is crucial part of software testing that
evaluates the speed, responsiveness, stability, and scalability of a system is Performance Testing.

13. Automated testing is the type I would recommend when human testing is time-consuming.
